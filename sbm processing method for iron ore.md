sbm processing method for iron oreVale will invest 11 billion reals in dry mineral. Dry mineral processing is related to the grade of iron in the mined ore.In Caracas,because of the high iron grade (more than 64%),the ore only needs to be crushed and screened,so it can be screened according to the size (particle size) of the ore.In Minas Gerais,iron exists in rocks known as &quot;iron quartzite&quot; with an average iron grade of 40%. Ore Body Model: Iron Ore Example 2018 11 18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the ore response in the process may also be impacted by extraction sequence,processing available,operators’ team working at the plant,and batch with which the extracted block was blended during the process.However,those factors would have a lower impact on the process performance in iron ore mining than in,for example,copper or gold ores.
