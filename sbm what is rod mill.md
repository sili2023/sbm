What is a Rod Mill? (with picture) Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working cond Grinding Laboratory Grinding Mill Laboratory Ball Mill. GTEK Laboratory Roller Rod Mill is a small sized,light and multi usage new pattern grinding equipment,designed for fine grinding in laboratories as well as in research institutes and mineral processing plant.It is also called Rolling Rod Mill. Rod Mill Feed Size Rod mills have become niche comminution devices since about 30 years ago.Because of mechanical limitations on rod length and the need to have an aspect ratio for the mill that avoids tangling (a potentially deadly failure for those tasked with rectifying the problem) rod mills have a maximum installed power of about 2.5 MW. Ball Mills vs Rod Mills When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend mos Rod Mills The Steel Head Rod Mill (sometimes call a bar mill) gives the ore dressing engineer a very wide choice in grinding design.He can easily secure a standard Steel Head Rod Mill suited to his particular problem.The successful operation of any grinding unit is largely depende Bar and Wire Rod Mill Steel Plantech Block mills.Using a block mill,which drives multiple rolling mills and has been used on 100m s class wire rod lines,as the bar steel finishing mill,will achieve speeds far beyond the finishing speed of ab Wire Rods Mill Manufactured in state of the art wire rods mills (WRMs) at Vijayanagar,our wire rods have a wide range of applications across industries.The low,medium and high carbon grades,electrode grade and CHQ grade are produced at Vijayanagar,while Salem Works produces alloy Bar and Wire Rod Mill Steel Plantech Block mills.Using a block mill,which drives multiple rolling mills and has been used on 100m s class wire rod lines,as the bar steel finishing mill,will achieve speeds far beyond the finishing speed of about 20m s that was the limit of conventional mills.
