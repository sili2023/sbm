Chocolate mass processing technologies 2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;As chocolate mass is a non Newtonian fluid we have to measure its shear stress at different shear rates,which results in a flow curve.Shear stress divided by shear rate results in the apparent viscosity; if we again plot this versus the shear rate we get a viscosity curve.For compounds the company offers a ball mill solution called.
