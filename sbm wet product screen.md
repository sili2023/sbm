Iron Ore Sintering: Process Sintering is a thermal agglomeration process that is applied to a mixture of iron ore fines,recycled ironmaking products,fluxes,slag forming agents,and solid fuel (coke).The purpose of the. Processing plant Roy Hill Processing plant.The processing plant consists of six individual scrubbing,screening and de sanding circuits.The wet scrubbing units are used to break down the sticky clays attached to the ore,into a fine suspended clay fraction suitable for subsequent wet beneficiation.Beneficiation is the process of separating the valuable material from the Control of Pollution in the Iron and Steel Industry 2017 1 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;semifinished product preparation the pollution is produced from the pouring of the.iron ore,coke breeze,limestone,mill scale,and flue dust into an agglomerated product (sinter) at suitable size for charging.exhaust,discharge,cooler and cold screen.The cleaning of the sintering process gases is one of the most difficult cleaning.
