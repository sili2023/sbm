GRINDING FEEDS AND SPEEDS &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The wheel speed,in terms of peripheral speed,is commonly in the range of 5,500 to 6,500 fpm (about 30 to 35 m sec).High speed grinding,operating at about twice that speed,is used on specially built surface grinding machines only,which are designed generally for abrasive machining and require appropriately manufactured grinding wheels. Ball Mill Critical Speed The critical speed of a rotating mill is the RPM at which a grinding medium will begin to “centrifuge”,namely will start rotating with the mill and therefore cease to carry out useful work.Ball mills have been successfully run at speeds between 60 and 90 percent of critical speed,but most mills operate at speeds between 65 and 79 percent.
