Sustainable cement production‚Äîpresent and future. Cement production has undergone a tremendous development from its beginnings some 2000 years ago.While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history,the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19th century,first with shaft kilns,which were later on replaced by rotary kilns as standard equipment worldwide. How Cement Is Made Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
