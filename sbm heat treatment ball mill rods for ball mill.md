China Grinding Balls,Grinding Media,Ball Mill Liner. Rong Mao Cast Steel Co.Ltd manufacture grinding balls,grinding media balls for mining,SAG Mill Trunnion Liner The rod mill feed head is conical in shape to give the essential feature of a feed entry pocket in front of the rods.BALL MILL DISCHARGE HEAD This head is of considerable depth providing a pulp lifting chamber,and is designed to contain the discharge grates,clamp bars,and the lifters which elevate the mill product through the trunnion. The history of the heat treatment of steel ball News. The history of the heat treatment of steel ball: in 1863,the British metallographer and geologists showed six different microstructure of steel under a microscope,which proved that during heating and cooling,there will be an organizational change in steel,the steel at high temperature phase in the quenched into a hard phase. Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Today we will learn about difference between sag mill vs ball mill.A mill is a machine by which solid or hard materials are broken into smaller pieces by means of grinding,crushing or cutting.This commutation is an essential part of many processes.Various kinds of mills are there Grinding Media Media to media contact for rods mills is linear rather than point to point (as with balls) and are much heavier.The larger feed tends to separate rods at the feed end such that larger particles are preferentially abraded.This leads to a narrower size distribution and significantly less slime compared to ball mills. Ball and Rod Mill Rod mills are grinding machine which employ high carbon steel or special steel rods of nearly the same length as that of the drum,in place of steel balls in ball mills.Rod mill products are generally coarser than those produced in a ball mill,and rod mills are well suited to handle coarser feed and to control the top size of the product. Ball mill The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other mater Grinding ball production line,cast ball heat treatment.
