sbm 650 tons of air millAir Pollution Emission Test: Project Report No.74 KPM 12. Based on the furnace production rates expressed in equivalent tons of unbleached air dried pulp per hour,and on the particulate emission rates for the total system,the following average process emission rates were determined for the No.5 recovery furnace: 3 Front half catch =1.33 Ib ton = 0.667 Kg 10 Kg 3 Total catch =1.72 Ib ton = 0.860 Kg. Dealing with Environmental Pollution in the Iron and Steel.
