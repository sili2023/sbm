TIG Tungsten Grinding TIG Tungsten Grinding It does depend on how your grinding it,a stone with a fine grit would be better,but try to avoid grinding it with the side of the tungsten towards the stone as the grind marks will cause the arc to be more unstable and sort of spiral off the tungsten where as if it's straight likes with the tungsten front on to the wheel it will have Machining Titanium on JobShop.com In studies conducted as early as 1950,the straight tungsten carbide (WC) cutting tools,typically C 2 grades,performed best in operations such as turning and face milling,while the high cobalt,high speed steels were most applicable in drilling,tapping,and end milling.Today,the situation is much the same. Metallurgist &amp; Mineral Processing Engineer The more complicated the processes become,the more difficult it is to achieve and maintain stability.In mineral processing,unlike most processing operations,we have limited control of the main input,the feed ore.In most cases this inherently is variable and usually outside of the processors control. What Is Tungsten Steel? Sciencing &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Cutting tools,such as drill bits,produce great heat from friction.Tungsten,added to steel in amounts varying from 2 to 18 percent (along with small amounts of molybdenum and vanadium),maintains the metal’s strength at high temperatures.Called high speed steel,it goes into making drill bits,milling bits,saw blades and other tools.
