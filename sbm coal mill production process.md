In coal fired power plants coal mills are used to pulverize and dry to coal before it is blown into the power plant furnace.The coal is feed into the coal mill through a central inlet pipe where gravity is used to lead the coal to the bottom of the mill,where the grinding table and some heavy rollers pulverizes the coal to particles. Coal mill cement production process lvssn The coal mill is a machine that crushes coal and grinds it into pulverized coal.It is an important auxiliary equipment of pulverized coal furnace.The coal grinding process is a process in which the coal is broken and its surface area is increasing.To add new surface areas the binding forces between solid molecules have to be overcome thus consuming energy.Coal is ground into pulverized coal. 4 Coal Mining and Processing Coal: Research and. The U.S.coal industry has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three decades.During this time,coal production has doubled,while the number of active miners has been halved and the number of mines has dropped by a factor of three ().This has resulted in the concentration of production in a smaller number of larger mines.
