Jaw Crusher As one of the typically rock crushing equipments in the world,Jaw crusher is mainly used for primary and secondary crushing.Rock is dropped between two high manganese steel Jaw plates,one is fixed jaw plate,one is movable jaw plate.Movable jaw plate moves up and down via eccentric shaft,and then crush the rock between the two jaw Jaw Crushers McLanahan Jaw Crushers are used to reduce the size of many different types of materials in many applications.The Jaw Crusher was first introduced by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858 as a double toggle Jaw Crusher.Introduced in 1906,McLanahan’s Universal Jaw Crusher was one of the first modern CRUSHERS JAW CRUSHERS New &amp; Used Mining &amp; Mineral … Single toggle jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.The swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. Jaw Crushers Crushing Equipment Minyu Machinery Corp. Minyu Jaw Crushers are configured for primary crushing of the hardest rock.Incoming material is crushed between the jaw crusher’s fixed die plate and movable die plate through advancing and retreating motions of the jaw crusher pitman arm.The Jaw Crus Crushing technology Jaw crushers operate according to the principle of pressure crushing.The crushing material is crushed in the wedge shaped pit between the fixed crusher jaw and the crusher jaw articulated on an eccentric shaft.The material is crushed by the elliptic course of movement and transported downwards. Crushers There are two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle.In the single toggle jaw crusher,an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher.Shaft rotation causes,along with the toggle plate,a compressive action.A double toggle crusher has two shafts Jaw Crusher China First Engineering Technology Co.Ltd. Through transmission of belts,the motor drives the eccentric shaft.Under drive of the eccentric shaft,the moving jaw does periodic motion towards the fixed jaw.When the space between the moving jaw and the fixed jaw reduces,the materials will be crushed.
