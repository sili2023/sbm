Iron Ore Introduction: Ore,which contains an economical use of iron,is called an iron ore.There are many types of iron ore,magnetite (Fe3O4),hematite (Fe2O3) and (FeCO3),etc,which are mainly used for iron making.Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises. A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel. The basis for charcoal fueled iron production in southern New Jersey was limonite,better known as bog iron.This form of iron was created in a chemical reaction between the tannin rich waters of the Pine Barrens and underlying iron rich sands and marls.The bog iron ore would rise up to the various creeks,rivers,and lakes of southern New Jersey.
