Copper Electrolysis Refining Plant,Purification of Copper. Even the best chemical method cannot remove all the impurities from the copper,but with electrolytic refining it is possible to produce 99.99% pure copper (whatever method is used to manufacture copper from its ore,its final purification is by electrolysis).P Aluminium smelting Aluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide,alumina,generally by the Hall H&#233;roult process.Alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the Bayer process at an alumina refinery.This is an electrolytic process,so an aluminium smelter uses huge amounts of electricity; smelters tend to be located close to large power station 12.1 Primary Aluminum Production The alumina is then shipped to a primary aluminum plant for electrolytic reduction to aluminum.The refining and reducing processes are seldom accomplished at the same facility.A schematic diagram of primary aluminum production is shown in Figure 12.1 1.12.1.2.1 Bayer Process Description In the Bayer process,crude bauxite ore is dried.
