sbm ranges of the sag mills for coer mineralsMining Industry: What is the difference of ball mill. Most mills used in mining rely on impact to breakdown rock to a suitable size for downstream processing.The impact can be rock on rock such as in an Autogenous Grinding (AG) mill,rock and a small ball charge (~10%),used in Semi Autogenous Grind. Outotec Grinding Mills We offer autogenous (AG),semi autogenous (SAG),ball,rod,and pebble mills in sizes ranging from kWs up to 30+ MW.Our product range also includes a number of unique solutions,including the world’s largest acid resistant grinding mills,which can operate with extremely corrosive slurry.
