What Is a Micron Rating? Micron Sizes for Water Filters What Is a Micron Rating? The average size of the openings between pieces of the filter media are represented in microns.For example,a 20 micron filter has larger openings than a 5 micron filter.Consequently,the 20 micron filter element will let larger particles pass through the filter than the 5 micron media would.
