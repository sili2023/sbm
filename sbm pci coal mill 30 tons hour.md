Pulverized coal injection method Pulverized coal injection is a method for improving the performance of a blast furnace.Background.Iron is a metal which has fundamentally affected the way of life of human beings ever since the Iron Age.It is relatively abundant and can easily be extracted and modified due to its useful material properties,all of which results in low prices. Blast Furnace Before injection,coal is ground to a fine powder of around 80% &lt; 75 μm (termed PCI pulverised coal injection) or to a granular powder of around 95% &lt; 1.7 mm (termed GCI granular coal injection).PCI is the dominant system favoured by Asian and most European steel mills but GCI has been in successful operation in British and USA mills. Coal fired power station A coal fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station.The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a furnace with a boiler.The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam,which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators.Thus chemical energy stored in coal is converted successively into thermal energy,mechanical e Air Cannons Move Sticky Coal From Bins At the US Steel PCI operation,a group of six air cannons was installed on each of the three feed hoppers below the railcar dump.To keep up with the steel mill’s around the clock,seven days per week schedule,the railcar dump must provide 3,000 tons of coal per day,every day.
