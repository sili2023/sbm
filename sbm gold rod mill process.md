How Gold Is Mined Gold Mining Process World Gold Council The lifecycle of a gold mine.People in hard hats working underground is what often comes to mind when thinking about how gold is mined.Yet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process.Long before any gold can be extracted,significant exploration and development needs to take place,both to determine,as accurately as possible,the size of the deposit as well. Ball mill The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.

Rod mills,how they function Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and brok Ball Mills In all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment. Rod mills,how they function The heavier rods acting upon the lifters and liners result in greater wear on the mill liners.Rod mills normally carry 35 to 65% rod charge by volume.The limits on charge level are (1) keeping the feed end trunnion open so that feed will get into the mill,and (2) keeping the rod charge low so rods will not work their way into discharge. The Hot Rolling Process The Hot Rolling Process The primary function of the Hot Strip Mill is to reheat semi finished steel slabs of steel nearly to their melting point,then roll them thinner and longer through 12 successive rolling mill stands driven by motors totaling 77,000 hp,and finally coiling up the lengthened steel sheet for transport to the next process.
