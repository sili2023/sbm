GotQuestions.org &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;What is a millstone in the Bible? Question: &quot;What is a millstone in the Bible?&quot; Answer: A millstone is a stone used to grind grain.When grain is milled,two stones are actually used: the bed stone,or base,which remains stationary; and the runner stone,which turns on top of the base,grinding the grain. Raglan Mudstone Teme Valley Geological Society HERE is a geology map of the area and notes on the formations.We parked near Ham Bridge at the entrance to the driveway leading to Ham Mill and Ham Farm.Along the way to the small quarry that was our destination we noted the very steep hillside we assumed cut into by the River Teme and obviously of a more substantial make up than the flat river valley. Millstone Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills,for grinding wheat or other grains.Millstones come in pairs.The base or bedstone is stationary.Above the bedstone is the turning runner stone which actually does the grinding.The runner stone spins above the stationary bedstone creating the &quot;scissoring&quot; or grinding action of the stones.
