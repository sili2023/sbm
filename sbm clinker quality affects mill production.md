Effects of Milk Handling on Quality and Hygiene Food Science Effects of Milk Handling on Quality and Hygiene.Cleanliness.The environment of production has a great effect on the quality of milk produced.For many reaosns including cow and udder health,food safety and dairy food quality,the production of the highest quality milk (lowest microbial content) should be the goal. Cement kiln heating the rawmix to sintering temperature (up to 1450 &#176;C) in a cement kiln; grinding the resulting clinker to make cement (see Cement mill).In the second stage,the rawmix is fed into the kiln and gradually heated by contact with the hot gases from combustion of the kiln fuel.Successive chemical reactions take place Process technology for efficient and sustainable cement.
