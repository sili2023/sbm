sbm ton sand gravity separation processIn Situ Bitumen Extraction Oil Sands Magazine About 80% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are too deep to be mined and must be extracted in place (or in situ) using steam.Bitumen is heated and pumped out of the ground,leaving most of the solids behind.In situ extraction has a much smaller footprint than oil sands mining,uses less water,and does not produce a tailings stream.
