It is shown that mechanical treatment in a ball mill leads to a decrease in the defects level,an increase in the Curie point and a demagnetizing factor of ferrite ceramics.The growth of the demagnetizing factor is associated with an increase in the porosity of ferrite ceramics samples pre grinded in ball. Laboratory Ball Mill Plans However,rod mills,like crushers,must be operated under controlled conditions to obtain maximum efficiency and are more difficult to operate than ball mills.Thus,the ultimate choice between a rod mill or ball mill for the primary grind may depend on the operator’s or designer’s experience as much as the metallurgist’s research.
