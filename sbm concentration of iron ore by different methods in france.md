Electrolysis of iron in a molten oxide electrolyte. This effect is illustrated by the two sketches in Fig.2,showing the incorporation of the different cations in the electrolyte structure.It becomes apparent that the choice of a silica based electrolyte with a low concentration of iron oxide can achieve a very low ferric ratio in the reducing conditions of the cathode. Uranium Mining and Extraction from Ore 2016 8 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The chemistry of these processes is very similar to the extraction methods,except that the leaching solution is pumped into the uranium ore while it is still in the ground.[2,5] Fig.3 shows a schematic of the in situ leaching process,in which the leaching solution is pumped into the ore zone containing the uranium ore.
