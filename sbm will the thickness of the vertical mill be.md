Career Trend A vertical milling machine's spindle axis is aligned in a vertical manner to the machine's bed.That means that the cutting tool is arranged vertically to shape the metal or other material into the desired form.The vertical mill moves while the part remains stationary. Milling Process,Defects,Equipment Manual vertical milling machine.The above components of the milling machine can be oriented either vertically or horizontally,creating two very distinct forms of milling machine.A horizontal milling machine uses a cutter that is mounted on a horizon Milling (machining) Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done varying direction on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty gang milling operations.
