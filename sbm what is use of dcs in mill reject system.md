sbm what is use of dcs in mill reject systemPLC vs.DCS Automation.com,October 2011 By Bill Lydon The idea of using a PLC based system rather than a DCS has become a philosophical and technical debate in the industry.DCSs have been the primary solution for process automation but now many PLC vendors are arguing that a single integrated architecture based on PLCs and or PACs is the best approach to total plant automation. Cogeneration In cogeneration this steam exits the turbine at a higher temperature where it may be used for process heat,building heat or cooling with an absorption chiller.The majority of this heat is from the latent heat of vaporization when the steam condenses.Thermal efficiency in a cogenera Metso Low Solids Measurement • a high solids rate in the reject water causes the excess centrate solids to be needlessly and potentially harmfully treated and centrifuged several times.Results In this example,automatic control has been imple mented in the mill’s automation system.In the figure … Application of ultrafiltration in a paper mill: Process.
