Study of residence time distribution and mill hold up for. The mill was loaded with 26.3 kg of 5 mm steel balls,corresponding to 60% of the mill volume filled by a ball bed.A steady state condition was established by feeding the sand at a given feed rate until the solid discharge rate attained the same value as the feed rate and the size distribution of the product did not change with time. Operating and Troubleshooting a Grinding Circuit In the operation of a grinding circuit you are managing several pieces of equipment as a single unit.If you make a change in the ore in the fine ore bin,that change will be reflected through the entire grinding process and beyond into the rest of the concentration system.The first thing that an operator will have to learn is to be able to tell when the rod mill is,or isn‚Äôt,grinding fine.
