Vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers Barmac&#174; vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers were the first vertical shaft impactors in the world.The original Barmac&#174; VSI crusher was developed in New Zealand over 40 years ago after which the VSI crushers have sprea What Is an Impact Crusher and What Can It Do for You? The mechanical structure of an impact crusher is defined by its rotor,the primary instrument for breaking apart material.The rotor is set among mounted plates,or aprons,inside a heavy cage; these aprons serve to bear the impact of the materials being processed and further break them apart. Impact Crushers Lippmann Milwaukee Lippmann Milwaukee impact crushers are fabricated to provide cost efficient crushing solutions to customers,without losing strength or efficiency.Due to the varying crusher sizes,Lippmann is able to provide a solution to any crushing scenario no matter the size. Impact Crusher Working Principle Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).
