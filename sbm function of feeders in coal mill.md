Coal Feeder is a device that regulates the amount of coal to be supplied into the Coal Mill.The amount of coal is regulated according to the needs in the boiler combustion chamber (furnace).The number regulation system in the coal feeder can be done in two ways based on Roller Mills Grinding Mills Williams Crusher Feeders for Williams Roller Millers.Since Williams Roller Mills are used on a wide range of materials,the proper feeder selection is essential for high capacity,trouble free operation.You can customize your roller feed mill depending on what material you need reduced. What is the function of a pulveriser in a thermal power. The basic function of a pulveriser in a Thermal Power plant is to break down and crush the coal lumps into fine particle form before it is taken to the boiler for burning.Pulverisation of coal basically breaks the big coal lumps and increases the. Pulverized Fuel Handling Systems: Unit,Central System, Crushed coal is fed to the pulverizer through feeder at a variable rate governed by the pulverizer through feeder at a variable rate governed by the combustion requirements of furnace and steam generating rates required in the boiler Hot air or fire gases are passed through the feeder to dry the coal before feeding to the pulverizer Pulverizer A control circuit monitors the coal level in the mill,and controls the speed of the raw coal feeder to maintain it.Maintaining the coal level in the mill offers a built in capacity cushion of pulverized fuel to take care of short interruptions in the raw coal circuit.The mill
