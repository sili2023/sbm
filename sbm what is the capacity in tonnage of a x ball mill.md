sbm what is the capacity in tonnage of a x ball millball mill for various capacity design A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size. Attritor,How attritor Works,Attritor working,Dry. MIKRONS &#174; Attritor is used for producing fine &amp; homogenous dispersions quickly &amp; repeatedly under controlled conditions.Used for the manufacture of ceramics,inks,paints,coatings,metal oxides,ferrites,chocolates,chemicals &amp; pharmaceuticals.The Attritor is often referred to as a agitated ball mill. Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills The two compartment ball mill operating in a closed circuit with a high efficiency separator is thus still the most preferred arrangement for new cement grinding installations although the vertical roller mill now has emerged as a viable alternative to the ball mill system and has increased its share of the market for cement mills over Laboratory Ball Mills,Planetary Ball Mill,High Energy.
