Clastic Sedimentary Rocks Clastic Sedimentary Rocks.Clastic sedimentary rocks are made up of pieces of other rocks.For example,sand on a beach or in a dune can get buried.Under the pressure of burial,the sand is pressed together and compacted.The individual sand grains are glued together by minerals such as calcite (calcium carbonate) and hematite (iron oxide. Clastic Sedimentary Rock Classification Sedimentary rocks are classified on the basis of the texture (grain size) of the rock,and composition.The basic classification only concerned texture,using the Wentworth size scale.But any full rock name must specify both texture and composition.Thus,an arkose sandstone is a rock of sand sized particles,with a high percentage of those particles being feldspar. Sedimentology and genetic stratigraphy of Dean and. Terrigenous clastic rocks display facies sequences,isopach patterns,and sedimentary structures suggestive of deposition from turbidity currents,and long lived saline density underflow and interflow currents.Clastic isopach patterns reflect an overall southward thinning of clastics in the Midland basin. Puntapin Rock Puntapin Rock is a granite rock formation located approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) south east of Wagin and approximately 30 km (19 mi) west of Dumbleyung in the western Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.It is a prominent feature in the area,rising out of the surrounding flat plains.The rock has an elevation of 310 m (1,020 ft) and an exposed surface of 42.5 ha (105 acres).
