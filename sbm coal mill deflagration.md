Advanced Tools to Evaluate Dust Explosions and Protective. &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Effective protective systems are a critical part of mitigating the consequences of dust explosions.Protective measures that can be implemented include explosion venting to protect the structural integrity of the vessel or suppression to inhibit the combustion and extinguish the deflagration,each in combination with isolation to prevent the explosion from propagating between interconnected. Deflagration &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Deflagration venting is an explosion protection measure that involves the provision of a predesigned escape route (called an explosion vent) for the release of the pressure and flame generated during an explosion quickly enough to prevent a dangerous build up of pressure within the vessel,pipes and ducts,or building that is being protected.As discussed in Pekalski, explosion disk coal mills Mill design features and benefits by Dr Caroline Woywadt &amp; R&#252;diger.design of mill and classifier housing,filter and pulverised coal silos.• use of rapid action flaps,rupture disks and explosion vents in certain parts of the plant.
