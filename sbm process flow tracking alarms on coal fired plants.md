Seamless Integration Automated Materials Handling for … Coal handling systems are an integral part of a complete material flow and quality management system.The increased degree of efficiency of modern coal power plants calls for an integrated coal handling management system in order to secure the coal supply in the requested quantity and quality. Coal Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. Stock Coal and Limestone Feed Systems actual process energy required on coal fired units (see graph on next page).In order to optimize boiler performance,achieve lower emissions and realize the resulting cost savings,Stock’s gravimetric feeders have become the industry standard in coal fired power Extraction and generation E.ON power plants and integrated with several control systems.In the 622 MW Staudinger 4 gas fired unit [1] and in the 900 MW Heyden 4 coal fired unit,it works with a Procontrol P unit control system.In the 420 MW Ingolstadt 4 oil fired unit and the 450 MW Thermal power station Types of thermal energy Almost all coal,petroleum,nuclear,geothermal,solar thermal electric,and waste incineration plants,as well as many natural gas power stations are thermal.Natural gas is frequently burned in gas turbines as well as boilers.The waste heat from a gas turbine,in the form of hot exhaust gas,can be used to raise steam by passing this gas through a heat recovery steam.
