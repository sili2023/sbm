sbm effectcascading effect in ball millOptimization of mill performance by using mill performance could become worse or better by putting in a new shell liner.Data from pilot plant test work illustrates the influence of the shell lifting effect on the grind for a primary grinding duty.Figure 5 shows the evolution of the mill discharge product size in relation to the lifting effect of the liners. Effect of Grinding Media on Milling Effect of Ball Diameter,or Rod Diameter Variation The first relationship to be considered is the effect of the variation of the ball diameter,or rod diameter,upon the size distribution obtained.In Fig.6.1 are shown typical size frequency curves obtained by ball milling; these curves being deduced from the data of Coghill and Devaney.
