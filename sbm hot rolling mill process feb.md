Rolling (metalworking) Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material.After the grains deform during processing,they recrystallize,which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal,like semi finished casting products,such as slabs,blooms,and billets. The Differences Between Hot and Cold Rolled Steel. NOTE: Hot rolling and cold rolling should not be mistaken for different grades of steel.Steels of different grades can be produced as hot rolled or cold rolled.HOT ROLLED STEEL.Hot rolling refers to a mill process in which you roll the steel at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature; a heat that typically exceeds 1000&#176; F. Difference Between Hot and Cold Rolled Steel Metal. &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hot Rolled Steel.Hot rolling is a mill process which involves rolling the steel at a high temperature (typically at a temperature over 1700&#176; F),which is above the steel’s recrystallization temperature.When steel is above the recrystallization temperature,it can be shaped and formed easily,and the steel can be made in much larger sizes.
