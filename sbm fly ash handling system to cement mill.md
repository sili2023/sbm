sbm fly ash handling system to cement millChapter 2 Fly Ash in Portland Cement Concrete.Overview.Fly ash is used in concrete admixtures to enhance the performance of concrete.Portland cement contains about 65 percent lime.Some of this lime becomes free and available during the hydration process.When fly ash is present with free lime,it reacts chemically to form additional cementitious. MELCO INDIA PVT.LTD The main categories of ash are bottom ash,fly ash,mill reject ash.Bottom ash,which accumulate at the bottom of the boiler in the form of lumps,requires mechanical,pneumatic conveying or hydraulic handling systems.Fly ash,which is more volatile,gets deposited at the bottom of the ash hoppers in the equipment downstream of the boiler. CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM PROJECT DESIGN … The project activity includes the following sub systems: 1.Transportation of fly ash from power plant to DCBL 2.Transfer of fly ash from tanker to fly ash silo 3.Fly ash handling and feeding system to cement mill 4.Fly ash mixing and transfer of Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) to storage silo 1.
