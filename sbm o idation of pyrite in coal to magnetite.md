Thermal phase transition of pyrite from coal … &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The thermal phase transition of pyrite from coal was studied using thermogravimetry and derivative thermogravimetric,infrared spectroscopy and X ray diffraction (XRD).According to the XRD results,the phase transition of the pyrite starts at 350 &#176;C,pyrrhotite and magnetite are intermediate products of the oxidation from pyrite to hematite. Oxidation of Pyrite The decomposition of pyrite was investigated in a thermo‐balance.In neutral or reducing gases it decomposes between 550&#176; and 700&#176;C to volatile sulfur and ferrous sulfide.
