Bagasse Power Biomassmagazine.com &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;When burned by a sugar mill,bagasse,the fibrous material leftover after juice is extracted from sugarcane,usually produces enough electricity to power all of the mill’s operations and then some.For every 10 metric tons of sugarcane crushed,a sugar factory produces nearly 3 metric tons of wet bagasse. Maize production Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important grain crop in South Africa and is produced throughout the country under diverse environments.Successful maize production depends on the correct application of production inputs that will sustain the environment as well as agricultural production.These inputs are,inter alia,adapted Chapter 18.Feed Milling Processes A control valve introduces dry steam into a header from which,through several port holes,steam enters the conditioning chamber in contact with dry feed.Between this valve and the steam generator or boiler are a strainer and trap to remove condensate,providing only dry steam in the mill.
