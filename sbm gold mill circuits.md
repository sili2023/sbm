Mill (grinding) A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.h Ore processing Waihi Gold The barren slurry,now known as tailings,is pumped to the tailings storage facility (5).In contrast,by the time the carbon reaches the first adsorption tank it has recovered most of the gold and silver from solution.This ‘loaded’ carbon is then pumped to the elution circuit (6) where the gold and silver is washed off with superheated water.
