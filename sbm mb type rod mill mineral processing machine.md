MBS Type Rod Mill Fote Machinery MBS Type Rod Mill can be used as an open circuit grinding mill,which is widely used in mineral processing,building materials,chemicals,refractory materials and other industries as well as the grinding operations which has higher requirements of finished products uniformity. Recommended Rod Mill Bar Length Ever asked what size length rods (bars) you need for charging your rod mill? It depends on the rod mill diameter itself.To prevent most conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the generally recommended relationship of rod length to mill diameter Inside liners is 1.4 to 1.6.When this ratio becomes less than 1.25 the risk of tangling Increases rapidly.
