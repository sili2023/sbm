Reservoir Carbonate rocks is a sedimentary rocks with carbonate fraction more than 50%.Carbonate rocks can be used as a reservoir because of its porosity and permeability.Carbonate rocks can be classified to clastic and non clastic sediment.Its environmental formation is tropic ocean. Clastic Sedimentary Rocks Clastic sedimentary rocks are classified according to the grain size of the sediment and the kinds of rock fragments that make up the sediment (Table ).Grain size is largely a function of the distance the particle was transported.In general,the greater the distance traveled,the smaller and more rounded the sediment particles will be. Clastic rock Britannica ‚Ä¶rocks are broadly known as clastic rocks because they consist of distinct particles or clasts.Clastic petrology is concerned with classification,particularly with respect to the mineral composition of fragments or particles,as well as the shapes of particles (angular versus rounded),and the degree of homogeneity of particle sizes. Lee Formation (VAPAl;0) The Lee Formation thickens and truncates progressively older rocks northwestward (Miller,1974).The intertonguing and unconformable relationship accounts for the great range in thickness for the Lee Formation.It ranges in thickness from 0 in southern Buchanan County (Meissner and Miller,1981),to 1680 feet in Lee County (Miller and Roen,1973).

Clastic rock Clastic rocks are composed of fragments,or clasts,of pre existing rock.Although,in principle,almost any rock made of eroded former rock is clastic (such as sandstone or mudstone),in practice the term is used for clasts of at least gravel size upwards.That means clasts are at least visible to the naked eye,and may be huge. 6.1 Clastic Sedimentary Rocks Physical Geology 6.1 Clastic Sedimentary Rocks A clast is a fragment of rock or mineral,ranging in size from less than a micron [1] (too small to see) to as big as an apartment block.Various types of clasts are shown in Figure 5.12 and in Exercise 5.3.The smaller ones tend to be composed of a single mineral crystal,and the larger ones are typically composed of pieces of rock.
