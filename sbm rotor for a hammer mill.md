Hammer Grinder A hammer mill is iron drum containing a vertical or horizontal rotating shaft on which hammers are fitted.Furthermore,the hammers are free to swing on the ends of the cross,or fixed to the central rotor.The rotor swim at a high speed inside the drum while material is fed through the feed in conveyor. Hammermill The basic principle is straightforward.A hammer mill is essentially a steel drum containing a vertical or horizontal rotating shaft or drum on which hammers are mounted.The hammers are free to swing on the ends of the cross,or fixed to the central rotor.The rotor is spun at a high speed inside the drum while material is fed into a feed hopper. Hammermill Maintenance change the hammer pattern by adding more hammers to prevent excessive hammer pin hammer hole wear.Always consult with the hammermill manufacturer when increasing the number of hammers in the pattern to avoid any danger of overloading the rotor plates.Long Term Maintenance Items Any com Producing a finer grind with a large rotor,high speed. large rotor,high speed hammermill Changing a hammermill’s screen hole size isn’t the only way to control the ground material’s particle size.Hammer tip speed,which increases with a larger diameter rotor,also af fects particle size.Read the informa tion here,adapted with permission from an article in the September 1994 issue of Feed.
