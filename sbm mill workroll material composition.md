sbm mill workroll material compositionBasic End Mills Technical Information MSC Industrial. End Mills are used for making shapes and holes in a workpiece during milling,profiling,contouring,slotting,counterboring,drilling and reaming applications.They are designed with cutting teeth on the face and edge of the body and can be used to cut a variety of materials in several directions. ROLLS FOR ROLLING MILLS Sleeves contribute to improvement of material utilization,since the material of sleeves is mostly consumed,and the roll shafts are used more than once.With roll shafts being re used 3 5 times,the coefficient of material consumption for sleeved rolls is 2 5 times as low as for solid forged rolls.
