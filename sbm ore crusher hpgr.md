HPGR Archives Henning Knapp,HPGR Process Team Leader for Weir Minerals,said the applications from this equipment have evolved from the cement production days of the 1980s and are increasingly being deployed as tertiary and quaternary crushers in mineral comminution circuits,dealing with tougher ores including iron, High Pressure Grinding High pressure grinding roll presses (HPGRs) are emerging as an important comminution technology in the minerals processing industry.The technology has found its key application in the liberation of diamonds and also in primary comminution.&#187; Pilot plant HPGR tests are necessary to evaluate the ore performance and to assess process and. Crushing in Mineral Processing In mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.
