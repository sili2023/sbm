The key factors that influence grinding media abrasion. For cement plant,not to mention different mineral points,even from the same point,as long as the mineral surfaces are different,the minerals will lead to different kinds of abrasion for grinding steel balls.2.determine hardness In dry grinding,confirming the relative hardness is necessary. Using Abrasion Index for calculating Steel Balls and mill. Grinding &amp; Classification Circuits.used in the Bond Ai test is made of SAE4325 steel hardened to 500 Brinell and therefore not necessarily equal to the hardness and abrasion resistance of commercial grinding media.Grinding media producers may have in house correlation factors of the Bond test steel and their own grinding steel wear rates. The hardness of grinding media ball Keep the hardness just right.When we choose wear resisting grinding media ball,often be the hardness problem of the grinding media ball.About the hardness,not the bigger the better,is the appropriate hardness value.Simply put,the higher the hardness,the greater the impact reaction during the process of falling,increasing the ball loss.
