Mill (grinding) A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.h How the Mill Works How the Mill Works.It starts with the grain… Of course,grist mills grind a variety of grains,such as wheat,rye and corn.But in Rhode Island,particularly at Gray’s Grist Mill,native grown corn,particularly Narragansett White Flint Corn,is the most common “grist for the mill.” The cement mill Cement manufacturing brief description of a cement mill.Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill.This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media normally steel balls.As the drum rotates,the motion of the balls crushes the clinker.The drum rotates approximately once every couple of seconds.
