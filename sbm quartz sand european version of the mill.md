sbm quartz sand european version of the millSilica IMA Europe Quartz may be transparent to translucent,hence its use in glassmaking,and has a vitreous lustre.Depending on how the silica sand was formed,quartz grains may be sharp and angular or rounded.For industrial use,pure deposits of silica capable of yielding products of at least 98% SiO2 are required. Respirable Crystalline Silica Quartz is found in most rocks,but particularly in sandstone (70 90% crystalline silica) and granite (typically around 30% crystalline silica); quartz is just yellow sand.Some minerals contain only a small amount of quartz,for example limestone and marble both have around 2% crystalline silica content.
