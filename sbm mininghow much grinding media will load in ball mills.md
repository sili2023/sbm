AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill. The percent of mill volume occupied by grinding media,J↓B:.Number,size and mass of each ball size depends on mill load and whether or not the media is being added as the initial charge.For the initial chargin of a mill,Coghill and DeVaney (1937) defined the ball size as a function of the top size of the feed,i.e.. A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear. A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear.The first attempts to develop tests for the assessment of wear of grinding balls in grinding mills date from the 1940s.In 1942,the idea of assessing the wear by marking some of the balls from the mill load was raised,carrying out the test in a batch ceramic mill.Later. Exploring ball size distribution in coal grinding mills. Tube mills use steel balls as grinding media.Due to wear in the abrasive environment it is necessary to charge new balls periodically to maintain a steady balanced ball charge in the mill.The amount and ball size distribution in this charge,as well as the frequency with which new balls are added to the mill,have significant effects on the.
