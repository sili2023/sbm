Yield stress and tensile strength obtained from coupon tests typically exceed those obtained from mill certificates.The correlation between values obtained from mill certificates and coupon tests is higher for tensile strength than for yield stress.The results appear to be independent of material thickness. Copra Copra (or khobara) is the dried meat or kernel of the coconut,which is the fruit of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera).Coconut oil is extracted from copra,making it an important agricultural commodity for many coconut producing countries.It also yields de fatted coconut cake after oil extraction,which is mainly used as feed for livestock. CRSI: Mill Test Reports The mill reports certify that the reinforcing bar conforms to the project specifications and reveals the chemical composition of the reinforcing bar and mechanical properties.Reinforcing bars typically come in two primary grades: Grade 60,which has a minimum yield strength of 60,000 psi,and Grade 75,which EXAMPLE 6 EXAMPLE 6 DECK DESIGN,INCLUDING COLLISION ON A TYPE 7 &amp; TYPE 10M BARRIER 6 2019 Where: Flexural cracking variability factor γ1 = 1.60 (non segmental brg.)
