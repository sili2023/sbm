Air Loss in Fly Ash Concrete Concrete Construction Magazine Loss on ignition (LOI) is a measurement of unburned carbon remaining in the ash.Specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM C 618) for fly ash used in concrete limit the LOI to 6 percent.Values greater than 2 to 3 percent,however,will probably require you to significantly increase the air entraining agent dosage. Fly ash in cement In our sector,fly ash is either put in the cement by the cement producer or it is mixed in at the concrete plant.HeidelbergCement,with operations both in cement and concrete production,has taken a strategic choice to add the fly ash in the cement.We believe this has several advantages.Adding fly ash to a cement mill leads to a more.
