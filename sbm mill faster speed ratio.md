High ratio gears are the opposite; the pinion has more teeth than the ring gear.So if the ring gear has five teeth while the pinion has 10,the ratio is now 2:1.For every one time the pinion spins,the ring gear spins twice to keep up,which is good for speed but not power. How do you choose the right gear ratio? Bassmaster &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Choosing the right gear ratio is all about technique and baits.Whether you want something slow,fast or somewhere in between depends on what it is you're fishing and how you're fishing it.For our purposes,I'll divide gear ratios into those three groups ‚Äî sl Sprocket Tuning For Pro Saws Performance Sprocket Tuning.Tuning pro saws for peak performance involves many factors,and one of them is sprocket tuning.Sprocket tuning or &quot;gearing,&quot; as it's sometimes called,affects the performance of professional chain saws,just as it does log trucks,race cars,and many other types of engine powered machinery.

Because theoretical performance is usually better than actual performance,even after accounting for inefficiency,it is important to choose motors and gear ratios with a healthy safety factor.That is,make sure that they will be able to handle more than the expected load at a faster than required speed. Speeds and feeds Schematically,speed at the workpiece surface can be thought of as the tangential speed at the tool cutter interface,that is,how fast the material moves past the cutting edge of the tool,although &quot;which surface to focus on&quot; is a topic with several valid answers.In drilling and milling,the outside diameter of the tool is the widely agreed. Wind Turbine Tip Speed Ratio REUK.co.uk Optimum Tip Speed Ratio.The optimum tip speed ratio depends on the number of blades in the wind turbine rotor.The fewer the number of blades,the faster the wind turbine rotor needs to turn to extract maximum power from the wind.A two bladed rotor has an optimum tip speed ratio of around 6,a three bladed rotor around 5,and a four bladed.
