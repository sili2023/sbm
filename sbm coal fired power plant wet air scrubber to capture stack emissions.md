Sulfur Dioxide Scrubbers An SO 2 scrubber system is the informal name for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) technology,which removes,or &quot;scrubs,&quot; SO 2 emissions from the exhaust of coal fired power plants.A scrubber works by spraying a wet slurry of limestone into a large chamber where the calcium in the limestone reacts with the SO 2 in the flue gas.There are some. Flue Gas If CO 2 is to be separated,as much as 100 megawatts of a typical 500 megawatt coal fired power plant would be necessary for today’s CO 2 capture processes based on the alkanolamines [4 6].Therefore,it would be highly desirable if the flue gas mixtures can be used for CO 2 conversion but without pre separation of CO 2. What Is A Wet Scrubber? 2020 2 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Also,the resultant scrubbing liquid must be treated prior to any ultimate discharge or being reused in the plant.A wet scrubber's ability to collect particulate matter is often directly proportional to the power input into the scrubber.Additionally,a properly designed and operated mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal.

What Do Scrubbers Do in Smoke Stacks? Sciencing Given the known health hazards from factory smokestack emissions,particularly those of coal burning electric power plants,it is highly desirable to reduce the emissions at their source.One proven way of doing this is to install scrubbers in the emission system.
