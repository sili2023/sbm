sbm wind sweep type coal mill production low factorWind Generation in NZ Wind turbines in New Zealand operate about 90% of the time,but the amount of electricity they generate is dependent on wind conditions.This is why wind generation is often referred to as “variable generation”.Wind farms,while variable in respect of short term production,are reasonably consistent on a quarterly and annual basis. Wind Energy Now Directly Competing With Coal On Cost. Wind Energy Now Directly Competing With Coal On Cost.A 1 MW wind turbine may only generate 40,000 MW hrs.over its lifetime. Capacity factor The capacity factor is defined for any electricity producing installation,such as a fuel consuming power plant or one using renewable energy,such as wind or the sun.The average capacity factor can also be defined for any class of such installations,and can be used to compare different types of electricity production. Wind power as an alternative to coal Wind power as an alternative to coal.the capacity factor achieved by the wind turbine fleet is shown to be increasing as the technology improves.The capacity factor achieved by new wind turbines in 2004 and 2005 reached 36%.But there are governmental actions available that could shift the current emphasis on coal production to one.
