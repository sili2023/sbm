Clastic Sedimentary Rock Classification Sedimentary rocks are classified on the basis of the texture (grain size) of the rock,and composition.The basic classification only concerned texture,using the Wentworth size scale.But any full rock name must specify both texture and composition.Thus,an arkose sandstone is a rock of sand sized particles,with a high percentage of those particles being feldspar.
