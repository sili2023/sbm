Metamorphic Rocks Earth Science Metamorphic rocks start off as igneous,sedimentary,or other metamorphic rocks.These rocks are changed when heat or pressure alters the existing rock‚Äôs physical or chemical make up.One ways rocks may change during metamorphism is by rearrangement of their mineral crystals.When heat and pressure change the environment of a rock,the. Metamorphic rock Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types,in a process called metamorphism,which means &quot;change in form&quot;.The original rock is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 &#176;C) and pressure (100 megapascals (1,000 bar) or more),causing profound physical or chemical change.The protolith may be a sedimentary,igneous,or existing metamorphic rock.
