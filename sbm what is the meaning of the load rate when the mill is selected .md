The Effect of Feed Rate and Cutting Speed to Surface Roughness The variables investigated were cutting speed (Vc),depth of cut (d),feed rate (fr) and the surface roughness (Ra).The result indicates that machining parameter that had the highest influence on surface roughness is the feed rate followed by the cutting speed and the Difference between Slew rate and Drive strength. If your slew rate is too slow,then as above your signal may not reach a valid logic level when it needs to.Slew rate is defintely taken into account by the timing analyzer tools.So basically you want the &quot;correct&quot; drive strength based on load and the &quot;correct&quot; slew rate based on output toggle rate. Bearing Load Calculation Bearing Load Calculation 4.3 Mean load The load on bearings used in machines under normal circumstances will,in many cases,fluctuate according to a fixed time period or planned operation schedule.The load on bearings operating under such conditions can be converted to a mean load (Fm),this is a load which gives SAG Mill Grinding Circuit Design A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Calculating Feeds The same applies to chip load if the recommended chip load is 0.1 mm tooth the RPM,feed or number of cutting edges may go up or down to maintain the required chip load.Therefore if chip load remains the same,and feed rate increases,either the RPM and or number of cutting edges must increase to maintain the recommended chip load.
