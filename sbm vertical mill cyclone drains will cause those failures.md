EC&amp;M These application tips and suggestions will help extend motor life in these hostile environments.If you have a motor application that involves operation in a wet or damp environment,you should know the proper choice of motor enclosure,the correct location of weep holes,and,in some cases,the use of an auxiliary heating device or system to warm the motor during nonoperating times. VAPOR LIQUID SEPARATION The effluent from a fossil fuel burning power plant,for instance,may contain sulfuric acid droplets,or other undesirable materials.Steam which has a little moisture entrained in it can leave undesirable silica deposits on superheater tubes.Water carried over into a turbine from a boiler can erode the blades and cause them to fail.

Horizontal Drain Horizontal drains are commonly installed to draw down water levels in slopes to add stability.They do this by unweighting the slope material and reducing unwanted excess pore pressures as described in Section 7.1.1 (Figure 7.13).Horizontal drains are generally the best alternative when the depth (or distance into a slope) to desired dewatering is great and where the costs of excavation and or.
