Effects of grinding media on grinding products and. The grinding tests were carried out in a vertical mill (JM 2,Changsha,China) at a constant rotational speed of 450 rpm.To better verify the effects of the grinding media on grinding products and chalcopyrite flotation behavior,the mill barrel was made of corundum with a volume of 200 mL,and the top of the stirring rod was covered with a nylon material. separation in mill ball mill Ball mill Wikipedia.The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressin vertical separator A vessel with its cylindrical axes perpendicular to the ground that is used to separate oil,gas and water from the production stream.The vessel can be a two phase or three phase separator.
