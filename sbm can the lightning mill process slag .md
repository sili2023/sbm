What is Slag? Australian Steel Mill Services Blast Furnace Slag can be processed into another form by Granulation.This process introduces the molten slag to water and creates an amorphous granular product which is typically minus 3mm.This product is marketed to the cement industry by ASMS as a cementitious material.Granulated blast furnace slag has product codes commencing with 'GBF'. Slag Handling Edw.C.Levy Co. Under the second method,pioneered by Levy,the molten slag is poured into a slag pot and transported by Levy to a remote dump station where the slag can safely be cooled and pre treated before processing.The third method is granulation at the furnace or remotely.Molten slag is subjected to jet streams of water or air under pressure.
