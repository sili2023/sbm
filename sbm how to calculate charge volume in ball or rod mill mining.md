sbm how to calculate charge volume in ball or rod mill miningRod mills,how they function Rod mills normally carry 35 to 65% rod charge by volume.The limits on charge level are (1) keeping the feed end trunnion open so that feed will get into the mill,and (2) keeping the rod charge low so rods will not work their way into discharge openings where they can cause rod tangling. Mill (grinding) A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank) Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum … In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and.
